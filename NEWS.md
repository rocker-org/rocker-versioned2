### Changes in pre-built images

- For images that ship with a python environment installed, the default python
  environment will now be a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)
  created at `/opt/venv`. ([#718](https://github.com/rocker-org/rocker-versioned2/pull/718))

### Changes in rocker_scripts

- `install_python.sh` will now setup a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)
  under `/opt/venv`, and this will be the default python environment (accomplished via setting
  the `$PATH` and `$VIRTUAL_ENV` variables). `/opt/venv` will be owned by the `staff` group so non-root
  users can safely install python packages. ([#718](https://github.com/rocker-org/rocker-versioned2/pull/718))

### Changes in pre-built images

- Switch the base URL of CRAN mirrors (P3M, formerly RSPM) from `https://packagemanager.posit.co/cran`
  to `https://p3m.dev/cran` ([#722](https://github.com/rocker-org/rocker-versioned2/pull/722))
- `rocker/verse` and images that inherit from it now include necessary
  LaTex packages to allow Rmarkdown to knit to PDF out of the box.
  ([#721](https://github.com/rocker-org/rocker-versioned2/pull/721))

### Changes in rocker_scripts

- `install_texlive.sh` will now install additional LaTeX packages
  required for Rmarkdown to knit to PDF. This will increase the
  build time and size of the final image in cases where
  `install_texlive.sh` is called.
  ([#721](https://github.com/rocker-org/rocker-versioned2/pull/721))

## 2023-10

### Changes in pre-built images

- `rocker/binder` now includes necessary LaTeX packages to allow Jupyter Notebooks to be converted to PDF. ([#714](https://github.com/rocker-org/rocker-versioned2/pull/714))

### Changes in rocker_scripts

- `install_jupyter.sh` will now install TexLive if it is not installed, and add
  additional LaTeX packages needed for Jupyter PDF conversion. This will increase
  the build time and size of the final image in cases `install_jupyter.sh` is called.

## 2023-04

### Changes in pre-built images

- New standards for R versions of images for routine builds. ([#624](https://github.com/rocker-org/rocker-versioned2/pull/624))
  - All patch versions associated with the last 2 minor versions (release and oldrel)
  - All minor versions R >= 4.0
- `rocker/binder`'s default command is changed from `jupyter notebook` to `jupyter lab`.
  ([#628](https://github.com/rocker-org/rocker-versioned2/pull/628))

## 2022-12

### Changes in pre-built images

- Switch the base URL of CRAN mirrors (RSPM) from `https://packagemanager.rstudio.com/cran`
  to `https://packagemanager.posit.co/cran` ([#574](https://github.com/rocker-org/rocker-versioned2/pull/574))

## 2022-11

### Changes in pre-built images

- `lsb-release` and `python3` (a dependency of `lsb-release`), are no longer included in `rocker/r-ver`.
  ([#511](https://github.com/rocker-org/rocker-versioned2/pull/511))

## 2022-10

### Changes in pre-built images

- cuda version tags, like `rocker/cuda:cuda10.1`, `rocker/ml:4.2.1-cuda10.1` are obsolete for R 4.2.2 or later images.
  Only the R version tags like `rocker/cuda:4.2.2`, `rocker/ml-verse:latest` will remain.
  `rocker/cuda` R >= 4.2.2 corresponds to `rocker/cuda:cuda11.1` before R.4.2.1 and
  uses `nvidia/cuda:X.Y.Z-cudnn8-devel-ubuntu22.04` as the base image.
  Therefore, the image size is significantly larger (+6GB) from `rocker/cuda` R <= 4.2.1,
  which installed cuda on `rocker/r-ver` (based on `ubuntu:focal`).
  ([#516](https://github.com/rocker-org/rocker-versioned2/pull/516))
- The aliases of `rocker/cuda` which was pushed to `rocker/r-ver`
  (`rocker/r-ver:X.Y.Z-cuda10.1` and `rocker/r-ver:X.Y.Z-cuda11.1`) are obsolete.
  ([#516](https://github.com/rocker-org/rocker-versioned2/pull/516))

## 2022-09

### Changes in pre-built images

- RStudio Server user settings are written to `~/.config/rstudio/rstudio-prefs.json`, not `~/.rstudio/monitored/user-settings/user-settings`.
  ([#63](https://github.com/rocker-org/rocker-versioned2/issues/63))
- In `rocker/rstudio` etc., `/usr/local/bin/rstudio-server` is no longer added to the PATH environment variable.
  `rstudio-server` and `rserver` can still be called by the executable file name,
  since simlinks are now created, but the other files must be called by their full path,
  e.g. `/usr/lib/rstudio-server/bin/rsession`.
  ([#535](https://github.com/rocker-org/rocker-versioned2/pull/535),
  [#538](https://github.com/rocker-org/rocker-versioned2/issues/538),
  [#541](https://github.com/rocker-org/rocker-versioned2/pull/541))

  ([#506](https://github.com/rocker-org/rocker-versioned2/pull/506))

    it will use the quarto cli bundled with RStudio instead of installing quarto cli.

  - New builds of `rocker/verse` and `rocker/ml-verse` for 4.1.0 <= R <= 4.2.0 will install quarto cli version 1.0.36.
  - New builds of `rocker/rstudio` and `rocker/ml` for R >= 4.2.1 (with RStudio Server v2022.07.1+554 or later)

  ([#328](https://github.com/rocker-org/rocker-versioned2/pull/328))
