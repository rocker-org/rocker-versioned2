In order to get coherent versioned Rocker containers, versions of R, R packages, RStudio Server, and TeX packages are match on a time scale by default.

For information about old images with 3.X.X tags, please check [the `rocker-org/rocker-versioned` repository](https://github.com/rocker-org/rocker-versioned/blob/master/VERSIONS.md).

## Rules

- For the base image, select the latest Ubuntu LTS version that is more than 90 days old at the release date of that R version.
  - The images for R 4.0.0 and R 4.0.1, which were released within 90 days of the release of Ubuntu 20.04,
  are based on Ubuntu 20.04 because the latest Ubuntu LTS was selected without setting an interval at that time.
- CRAN date is the date of the last CRAN snapshot in the era when that R version was the latest.
  - If that R version is the latest, the CRAN date will not be set and the latest packages will always be installed.
- RStudio version is the latest stable RStudio version of the era when that R version was the latest.
  - If a new RStudio is released when that R version is the latest, the configuration will be updated to install the new RStudio.
- CTAN date is the day before the next R version release date.
  - If that R version is the latest, the CTAN date will not be set and the latest packages will always be installed.
